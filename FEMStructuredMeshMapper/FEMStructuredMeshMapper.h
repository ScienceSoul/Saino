// This class implements a plug-in for mapping the mesh between given top and
// bottom surfaces. This solver assumes that the mesh is structural so that it
// could have been obtained by extrusion in the direction of interest. For the
// given direction the corresponding top and bottom node is computed for every
// node and this information is used to perform linear mapping in between.
